WoodscanDownloadManager
=======================

WoodscanDownloadManager is a Qt based companion tool for the Woodscan bar-code reader to update the bar-code database provided with the reader.

The main purpose I made the tool open source is to illustrate:

- How to download a file including pause and resume.
- How to identify our Milestone Bones Audio Player on the USB Bus.
